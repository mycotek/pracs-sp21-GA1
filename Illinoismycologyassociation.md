# The Illinois Mycological Association
## About
The Illinois Mycological Association (IMA) is a group of people that help facilitate the teaching and  learning of the wild mushrooms found in Illinois. They do this by holding monthly meetings and weekly forays. 
## My experiences with the IMA
I started attending forays with the IMA as a complete novice and beginner. By attending their forays and meeetings, I was able to grow an appreciation and knowledge base to identify mushrooms. The IMA did not just teach the common name such as the death cap but would use their latin names such as *Amanita bisporigera*. I **highly** recommend anyone who's in the Chicagoland area and interested in mushrooms to attend their meetings and forays.
